    "detailed_feedback": "The candidate's interview performance demonstrates a foundation of technical skills and genuine enthusiasm. However, several communication issues significantly detract from their overall impact. The excessive use of filler words ('um', 'like', 'actually') disrupts fluency and reduces perceived confidence.  The slow pace of speech, while indicative of careful thought, also limits engagement.  The relatively simple sentence structure contributes to a monotone delivery and hampers clarity. While acknowledging a weakness (public speaking) is positive, the candidate needs to demonstrate proactive mitigation strategies beyond simply joining a Toastmasters group. The content itself is relevant, but lacks depth and compelling storytelling.  Improved articulation and increased sentence variety would significantly enhance the overall professionalism and impact.  By focusing on eliminating filler words, increasing speech pace, and improving sentence structure variation, the candidate can significantly boost their confidence and interview performance.",
