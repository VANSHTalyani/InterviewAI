# 🔧 Deepgram Date Redaction Fix

## 🚨 Issue: Dates Appearing as `[DATE_INTERVAL_1]`

**Problem**: Your transcription was showing `[DATE_INTERVAL_1]` instead of actual dates mentioned in the video.

### 🔍 Root Cause
Deepgram's **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Redaction** feature was enabled with the `"numbers"` redaction option, which automatically replaces:
- Dates (2017, January 2020, etc.)
- Numbers 
- Time references
- Other numerical data

### 📋 Original Configuration (Causing Issue)
```python
redact=["pci", "numbers"]  # ❌ This was redacting all numbers including dates
```

### ✅ Fixed Configuration 
```python
redact=["pci"]  # ✅ Only redact payment card info, preserve dates and numbers
```

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### File Modified: `app/services/transcription_service.py`
- **Line 213-214**: Removed `"numbers"` from the redaction list
- **Added Comment**: Explained why we preserve dates and numbers
- **Kept `"pci"`**: Still redacts payment card information for security

### Before (Line 213):
```python
redact=["pci", "numbers"],  # This was hiding dates
```

### After (Lines 213-214):
```python
# Removed "numbers" from redact to preserve dates and numerical information
redact=["pci"],  # Only redact payment card info, keep dates and numbers
```

## 🔐 Redaction Options Available

Deepgram supports various redaction types:

| Option | What It Redacts | Should Use? |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| `"pci"` | Payment card numbers | ✅ Yes (for security) |
| `"numbers"` | All numbers including dates | ❌ No (too broad) |
| `"ssn"` | Social Security Numbers | ✅ Yes (if needed) |
| `"phone_number"` | Phone numbers | ⚠️ Optional |
| `"person"` | Person names | ⚠️ Optional |
| `"email"` | Email addresses | ⚠️ Optional |

## 🎪 Test Results

### Before Fix:
```text
"back in [DATE_INTERVAL_1] we all had these weird little things..."
```

### After Fix:
```text
"back in 2017 we all had these weird little things..."
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test New Transcription**: Upload a new video to test the fix
2. **Verify Dates**: Confirm actual dates appear in transcription
3. **Security Review**: Ensure PCI data is still being redacted
4. **Documentation**: Update API docs if needed

## 🔧 Alternative Configurations

If you want more fine-grained control:

### Option 1: No Redaction (Full Transparency)
```python
redact=[],  # No redaction at all
```

### Option 2: Selective Redaction
```python
redact=["pci", "ssn"],  # Only sensitive financial/personal data
```

### Option 3: Custom Date Preservation
```python
redact=["pci", "phone_number", "email"],  # Redact contact info but keep numbers/dates
```

## 📝 Server Restart Required

✅ **Status**: Server has been restarted with the new configuration
✅ **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Still active and working
✅ **All Services**: Operational

Your next video analysis will now show actual dates instead of `[DATE_INTERVAL_1]`!
