## Overview

The job interview process is often a black box. Candidates struggle to get honest, constructive feedback on their performance. InterviewAI solves this by creating a practice environment that simulates real interviews and provides data-driven analysis. Users can record themselves answering questions, upload the video, and receive a detailed report generated by a powerful AI pipeline, helping them identify and correct weaknesses before the real interview.

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Standard, secure registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Personalized Dashboard**: A central hub for users to track their progress, review past interviews, and view performance analytics.
- **AI-Powered Video Analysis**: Upload video recordings to receive comprehensive feedback on verbal and non-verbal cues.
- **Real-time Feedback Metrics**: Analysis of speaking pace, tone of voice, use of filler words, and body language.
- **Dynamic Question Bank**: Access a wide range of HR and technical questions tailored to various roles and industries.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB v6+
- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- Git

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VANSHTalyani/InterviewAI.git
cd InterviewAI
```

2. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

3. **Start all services with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend (Node.js): http://localhost:5000
- Python Server: http://localhost:8001
- MongoDB: localhost:27017

### Manual Setup (Development)

### Backend Setup
First, clone the repository and set up the backend server.
```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/VANSHTalyani/InterviewAI.git
cd InterviewAI

# Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Create the environment file from the example
cp .env.example .env
````

Next, open the `.env` file and populate it with your credentials (database URI, API keys, etc.).

Ensure your MongoDB instance is running, then start the server:

```bash
# Optional: Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The backend will now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Python Server Setup

In a new terminal window, set up the Python server:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory (where Python server is located)
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Python server
python main.py
```

The Python server will now be running at `http://localhost:8001`.
### Frontend Setup

In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory from the project root.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend from the root 'InterviewAI' directory
cd Frontend/project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

The `VITE_API_URL` in the `.env` file should already be pointing to your local backend.

Now, start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

-----

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints.

#### Authentication

  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a token.
  - `GET /api/auth/me`: Retrieve the profile of the currently logged-in user.
  - `GET /api/auth/logout`: Log out the user.

#### User Management

  - `GET /api/users/stats`: Get user-specific statistics.
  - `PUT /api/users/profile`: Update user profile details.
  - `PUT /api/users/password`: Change the user's password.

#### Interviews & Analysis

  - `GET /api/interviews`: Fetch all interviews for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /api/interviews`: Create a new interview entry.
  - `GET /api/interviews/:id`: Get a single interview by its ID.
  - `DELETE /api/interviews/:id`: Delete an interview.
  - `POST /api/interviews/:id/upload`: Upload a video file for analysis.
  - `POST /api/interviews/:id/analyze`: Start the AI analysis process for a video.

#### Python Server Endpoints

  - `POST /api/v1/upload`: Upload video files for processing
  - `POST /api/v1/process/{filename}`: Process video (extract audio/frames)
  - `POST /api/v1/comprehensive/analyze-speech`: Comprehensive speech analysis
  - `GET /api/v1/comprehensive/services-status`: Check AI services status
-----

## Development Workflow

To work on the project, you'll need to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently in separate terminals.
### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose up --build
```

### Manual Development

  - **To run the Backend Server**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
  - **To run the Python Server**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python main.py
    ```
  - **To run the Frontend Server**:
    ```bash
    cd Frontend/project
    npm run dev
    ```

# URL of the backend API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_PYTHON_API_URL=http://localhost:8001/api/v1
```

#### Python Server Environment

The Python server uses the same `.env` file in the backend directory and reads:
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` 
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`
